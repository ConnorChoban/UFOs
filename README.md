# UFOs

Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to compile data surrounding UFO sightings and display it in a webpage that's easy to use and that will allow us to filter by different search criteria. This way the UFO data is readily accessible for anyone who wishes to use it to perform their own data analysis.

Results

In order to conduct a search, on the left side of the table I inserted 5 text boxes where the user can search and filter data by date, city, state, country, and shape. Below these boxes, there is a button that can be pressed in order to realize the search (Note that this is different than the one created during the module). To refresh the page, in addition to clicking the refresh button, the user can also click in the top left corner where it says "UFO Sightings" to reload the page in case they want to remove all filters.

Summary

One of the major disadvantages is that the program is case sensitive; for example, you would have to search by ar for Arkansas instead of AR otherwise the code will throw an error. This could cause some confusion for search criteria such as cities, states, or countries since they're proper nouns. 

I mentioned above that by clicking on the "UFO Sightings" text on the top section of the page one could reload the page to return to the initial dataset. We could take this a step further and add an actual "Refresh" button next to or under the "Filter Search" button. 

Additionally, the code in this prgram is relatively simple, and additional search boxes could be created to search by duration or other criteria should the data set by expanded to include more data beyond things like city, state, or country (time of day could be anotfer factor, for example).
