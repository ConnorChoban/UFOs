# UFOs

#Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to compile data surrounding UFO sightings and display it in a webpage that's easy to use and that will allow us to filter by different search criteria. This way the UFO data is readily accessible for anyone who wishes to use it to perform their own data analysis.

Results

In order to conduct a search, on the left side of the table I inserted 5 text boxes where the user can search and filter data by date, city, state, country, and shape. Below these boxes, there is a button that can be pressed in order to realize the search. To refresh the page, in addition to clicking the refresh button, the user can also click in the top left corner where it says "UFO Sightings" to reload the page in case they want to remove all filters.

Summary

One of the major disadvantages is that the program is case sensitive; for example, you would have to search by ar for Arkansas instead of AR otherwise the code will throw an error. This could cause some confusion for search criteria such as cities, states, or countries since they're proper nouns.
